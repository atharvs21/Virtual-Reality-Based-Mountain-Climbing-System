# Virtual Reality-Based Mountain Climbing System

## Overview

The **Virtual Reality-Based Mountain Climbing System** is an immersive VR application developed as a course project at **IIT Kanpur**, under the supervision of Prof. Amar Behera from the Department of Design. This project utilizes **Unity** and **Meta Quest** to create a realistic mountain climbing simulation, providing users with an engaging and authentic climbing experience in a fully immersive 3D environment.

## Key Features

- **Immersive VR Application**: Developed a virtual reality application that simulates realistic mountain climbing scenarios using Unity and Meta Quest.
- **Intuitive User Interactions**: Implemented precise and user-friendly interactions for terrain navigation and equipment handling through VR controllers.
- **Optimized Performance**: Ensured seamless rendering and accurate motion tracking to enhance the immersive experience within the VR environment.
- **Rigorous Testing**: Conducted extensive testing to assess system compatibility, minimize motion sickness, and refine the overall user experience.
- **Physics-Based Climbing Mechanics**: Integrated advanced climbing mechanics to provide a challenging and realistic climbing experience.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Created detailed project documentation including setup instructions, safety guidelines, and troubleshooting procedures to support users and developers.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: For developing the VR application and creating the 3D simulation environment.
- **Meta Quest**: For immersive VR hardware and user interaction.
- **VR Controllers**: For intuitive handling of terrain navigation and equipment within the virtual space.
- **Physics Engine**: For implementing realistic climbing mechanics and interactions.
